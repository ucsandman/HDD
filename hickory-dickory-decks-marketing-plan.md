## Part 1: The Review Generation Engine for HDD

### Current State
HDD already has strong ratings (4.8-4.9 across platforms), but reviews are the #1 local ranking factor for contractors. The goal is to systematically capture reviews from every completed project.

### HDD-Specific Review Request System

**The Post-Project Review Workflow:**

```
Deck build completed + final walkthrough done
       ↓
Day 1 (same day): Franchisee sends personalized thank-you text
       ↓
Day 3: Automated SMS with direct Google review link
       "Hi [Name], we hope you're enjoying your new Hickory Dickory Deck! 
        If we earned it, a quick Google review helps other homeowners 
        find quality deck builders: [direct-link]
        Thanks for trusting us with your backyard! - [Franchisee Name]"
       ↓
Day 7: If no response → Gentle email reminder with project photo attached
       ↓
Day 14: Final touchpoint → Thank you card in mail (optional premium touch)
```

**Review Routing Logic (Critical for Protecting Ratings):**

1. **First step:** Send to a sentiment check page
   - "How was your experience with your Hickory Dickory Deck?"
   - Happy face = Route to Google Business Profile
   - Unhappy face = Route to private feedback form that goes to franchisee + head office

2. **Why this matters:** Your 4.9 rating is a massive competitive advantage. One negative public review during peak season could cost multiple leads. Routing dissatisfied customers to private feedback lets you resolve issues before they become public.

### Platform-Specific Review Strategy

| Platform | Priority | Why It Matters for HDD |
|----------|----------|------------------------|
| Google Business Profile | #1 | Drives local pack rankings, most searched |
| Houzz | #2 | Homeowners specifically look here for contractors |
| TrustedPros | #3 | Strong in Canadian markets |
| HomeStars | #4 | Canadian-specific, high trust |
| Angi/HomeAdvisor | #5 | US market expansion |
| Facebook | #6 | Social proof for ads |

### Review Request Templates for HDD

**SMS Template (Day 3):**
```
